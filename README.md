# Gomez-Portfolio-2022
Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data, Spring 2022

# About Me
I am a second year masters student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy in the Master of Public Policy and Management graduate program. I completed my undergraduate education in architecture and public policy at Carnegie Mellon (B.A. Architecture '16) and is currently doing research with Metro21 on broadband infrastructure and smart cities.

Upon graduation, I hope to work either in a spatial analytics consulting firm or in a city's Office of Innovation on projects that leverage geospatial technologies to investigate urban issues like transportation, housing, and infrastructure. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to develop a better eye for graphic design and visual composition. Given my background in architecture, I can recognize the importance of having a well-trained eye and am hoping to apply the level of rigor and refinement that architecture demands within the realm of data analysis and visualization.
