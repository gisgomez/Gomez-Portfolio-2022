The figure above shows general government debt as a percentage of total GDP in 2018 across multiple countries. The visualization below further explores this dataset and examines government debt not just in 2018, but throughout history and recent years.

The visualization below shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of multiple countries from 1995 to 2019.

# Discussion of Visualization Methods
Data Visualization (DV) 1 is a basic bar chart showing nations' debt-to-GDP ratio for one specific year - 2018. This visualization is effective at compare and contrasting multiple nations but is limited to showing data from only one year. In contrast, DV 2 is a series of line charts and is graphically better at representing changes over time across multiple countries. The line chart communicates well trends over time by generalize the data into a line that is easily read and understood by viewers. DV 3 is a series of bar charts which better visually communicates  the highs and lows over time compared to a line chart since historical and present day trends are more smoothed and abstracted in the line chart than in the bar chart. The bar chart series was a compelling visualization because it allows the reader to easily identify years where a country's debt-to-GDP ratio was particularly high or low compared to historical data.
