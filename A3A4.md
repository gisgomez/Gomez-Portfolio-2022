# The Lyrical Composition of Rap: Rapper’s Vocabulary in Hip Hop 

The data visualization below is taken from ThePudding (found here: https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/), an online forum for data journalism and storytelling, and is part of a project examining the lyrical composition of rap and hip hop by different artists throughout time. My analysis of the author’s work will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the data visualization as well as suggest recommendations for improvements which will first be wireframed then tested for feedback before finally implementing the suggested edits.


First Impressions

What initially stood out to me is how thorough the data visualization is as the authors opted to include multiple artists from different eras and also decided to color-code by era which I feel was a particularly smart choice as it helps contextualize the history of rap and hip hop between the 1980s and the 2010s. The color coding is visually very effective as it works well to highlight key differences in the lyrical composition of rap and hip hop by artists active in the 2010s and those active through the 1980s and 1990s-2000s especially. Considering that the horizontal axis on this chart represents the number of unique words, the color coding works well to show a visual distribution and compare across different eras of rap and hip hop as most 2010s artists (shown in red) are skewed to the left implying that there are less unique words used while a good amount of 2000s artists are centered or mildly right-skewed. Although the color coding works well to draw quick insights from the data, the color scheme could be improved as some colors like red and blue take visual priority over other colors like the muted green and magenta colors that are used in the chart. 

An aspect I feel did not work well is the scale on the horizontal axis as I feel it’s a bit confusing for me to understand. It is especially unclear how bin sizes were selected by the authors; I would be curious to see how the data might be better distributed into bins and to determine that there would need to be examination of the dataset’s general distribution. Also on the horizontal axis, the repetition of the phrase “unique words” is distracting and could be consolidated into an axis title that is more descriptive and better contextualizes the data. One final point of observation was noticing how some artists' names were cut off or shortened as they were too long and went over the allotted character limit. I feel that might be ineffective in terms of communicating information clearly and might be interested in exploring how changing the orientation and layout of the chart might help adjust how artist names are rendered. 


Wireframing: What is the narrative?

In making changes to the data visualization, I first began by cleaning the source data sheet in excel which involved deleted extraneous information as the original dataset (pictured below) had additional columns that were not relevant to the narrative of the analysis I intended to carry out.

The cleaned dataset (pictured below) was made to be much more concise and only included three variables: the artist’s name, their respective era, and a count of the number of unique words.

After better understanding my first impressions of the data visualization and cleaning the dataset in excel, I began to focus on wireframing the improved version in Flourish. From the original data visualization, I was most captured by the time aspect of the author’s analysis and wanted to focus on the element of classifying rappers by era in my revised data visualization. With this narrative in mind, my first iteration sought a more interactive approach. Using the survey layout, I imported the dataset into the software and adjusted the bubbles to be grouped and rendered visually by era as well as modified the bubble’s size to reflect the number of unique words. Labels with the rapper’s name were also added to each bubble; a title and subtitle were also added to provide a synopsis of the visualization as well as include some insight about the author’s method for measuring the number of unique words.

Feedback on this iteration was quite mixed. When asked to describe what the data visualization was showing, the two interviewed users were not immediately able to understand the context of the survey chart. One of the primary reasons for this issue was the fact that the labels, which indicate a rapper’s name, were not big enough to read from a distance and did not register to the readers immediately which caused them to miss out on important context. I preemptively tried to workaround this issue early on in the prototyping phase by including a feature that allows users to scroll in and out as well as incorporating a feature that generates a pop-up when hovering over a bubble. Despite these efforts, the interviewees mentioned that it was difficult to understand the story shown by the visualization. Upon further examination and additional context, the interviewees also mentioned that they felt this visualization focused more on who the artist was instead of what era the artist was from, the latter of which was my intent for the revised data visualization. When asked what could be done differently, feedback focused on the fact that sizing bubbles by the number of unique words was highly ineffective as the different sizes barely registered to the interviewees at first glance. 

Understanding that the first iteration of edits and redesign had not captured the narrative I had in mind, I decided to wireframe another solution in Flourish this time using a scatter plot layout. Following the method used for the first iteration, I implemented the data into Flourish and assigned the variables accordingly to create the visualization shown below.

When shown this visualization, interviewees remarked that there was an immediate improvement in their visual understanding of the narrative and purpose of the visualization as they felt this iteration focused more on highlighting changes throughout eras of rap and hip hop. Feedback on this iteration was generally more robust and specific than feedback on the first iteration. When asked what could be done to improve the visualization, interviewees suggested omitting the data points from the 1980s as they felt it was detracting from the overall narrative and did not add much given the comparatively smaller sample size of rappers from this era. Other suggestions for improvement included doing away with sizing dots by the number of unique words as that both did not register clearly to the viewers and was repetitive given that the same information was better communicated via a dot’s movement along horizontal axis. One thing that was suggested but was ultimately not implemented due to technical difficulties in Flourish was to add callouts highlighting the one or two most popular or well-known rappers in each era so as to serve as a point of reference and contextualization for audience members.

The Final Visualization

The final visualization is based mostly off the second iteration done during the wireframing and prototyping phase. This iteration was selected for further improvement and final implementation because of the way it most closely aligns with the intended narrative around showing the change of lyricism and vocabulary in rap and hip hop throughout time. In comparison to the original data visualization this visualization focuses less on individual rappers as there are no names present until a user hovers over a dot on the chart. However, this visualization better highlights how rappers have changed the genre overtime.
