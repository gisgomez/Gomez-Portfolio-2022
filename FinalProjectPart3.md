# Final Project, Part Three #

Part Three of the final project involved refining the data narrative proposed in [Part Two](https://gisgomez.github.io/Gomez-Portfolio-2022/FinalProjectPart2), editing data visualizations made during the first iteration of wireframing the final storyboard, and finalizing the writeup that accompanies the data visualizations. Part Three also involved preparing a one-minute presentation of the project and delivering that presentation to an audience. More information about the process behind Part Three is outlined below. 

In Part Two, the data narrative was modified to focus more specifically on the proliferation of telehealth services during the pandemic and the long term implication on people’s access to telehealth services moving forward. Data exploration conducted during Part Two facilitated the creation of preliminary data visualizations to be used during user interviews. During Part Two, the target audience was also more clearly identified as the call to action was further developed and understood within the data narrative. The interviews conducted during this part of the project helped to understand the extent to which the visualizations and preliminary storyboard communicated the data narrative and call to action effectively to interviewees and the target audience. 

# Lessons from Part Two #
The user interview process conducted in Part Two provided me with valuable insights about what was working well and what needed to be revisited in Part Three. Findings from the user interviews conducted in Part Two which were instrumental to making changes in Part Three are outlined below: 

* Strengths
  * The data is effective at producing reactions that challenged interviewee’s expectations which gives way to more robust conversations 
 * The call to action is clear and is something that one interviewee would feel comfortable taking immediate action on 
* Weaknesses
  * The wireframe could use more detailed data visualizations
  * The aspect of legislation around state and federal coverage of telemedicine needs to be more incorporated into the data story, either via data visualizations or some further discussion 

According to feedback from interviewees, the data visualizations that were drafted for the preliminary storyboard were effective at challenging their preconceived notion of what the data might reveal. This perspective prompted further data exploration in Part Three which led to the creation of four new data visualizations exploring more specific sub-groups of the surveyed populations: transgender adults, senior citizens, adults with chronic conditions, and residents of non-metropolitan areas. Part of the motivation behind revisiting the data visualizations also came from feedback about what could be improved, specifically around including more detailed data visualizations. I recall one interview mentioning a lack of detail and two interviewees commenting that the visualizations were effective as they were. Balancing these opposing views was a bit challenging but proved to be absolutely necessary as a made edits in Part Three. 

Interestingly enough, other aspects of the data narrative and storyboard produced in Part Two produced opposing views among interviewees. Some thought that the call to action was clear as it was presented to them, while others expressed that there needed to be more discussion of federal and state legislation around telemedicine to help further contextualize the call to action. Taking both perspectives into account, in Part Three the call to action was revisited and refined to reflect feedback from both perspectives. Ultimately, I think the competing perspectives were a result of my own inconsistency with how the call to action was explained to interviewees. Given the mixed feedback, in Part Three I prioritized making the call to action clearer and making the follow up process easier for interested audience members. Edits made in Part Three also focused on strengthening the link between the data narrative and the call to action. 

Finally, one of the biggest changes since Part Two was creating the writeup for the storyboard. This process involved first making edits to the data visualizations, integrating them into the data narrative, and discussing the implications of the analysis on the central point which also involved some outside research to find additional supporting evidence. This process was first done for each data visualization, then each write up was incorporated into the larger narrative.

# Finalizing the Storyboard in Shorthand #
After implementing the changes discussed above, the storyboard was ready to be built and published via Shorthand. The final document can be accessed [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/telemedicine-covid-and-beyond/index.html).A written version of the Shorthand storyboard is also available as a PDF [here]().
