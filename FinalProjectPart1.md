# Final Project, Part One # 

# The New Urban Geography of Work #

## Project Outline ##

I. Summary: The shift to remote work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is fundamentally changing the country’s urban landscape. As both employers and employees embrace remote work as a long-term method of operation, migration and settlement patterns across the country are changing to reflect adjustments in people’s lifestyle and cost of living. This project aims to examine how urban areas are evolving as a result of the pandemic and remote work through data analysis and data visualization. 

II. Elements: Given the geographic component of this project, Esri Story Maps will be integral to organizing data and communicating the narrative. The vision for this project is to examine changes in migration patterns due to the COVID pandemic by highlighting case studies that look at “Zoom towns”, or small to mid-sized urban areas that have experienced an influx of remote workers from large urban areas.

IV. Data: Data for the project will come from a variety of sources, some of which are described below. This list of data sources is not exhaustive as there are more sources to be identified. 
    A. Zillow: data on areas where there has been greater activity in the real estate market due to increased interest in vacation or secondary homes
    B. American Community Survey (ACS): the 2020 ACS data can provide insight into trends on population changes in urban areas
    C. Apartment List: data on apartment vacancy rates in urban areas 

V. Method and Medium: Through a series of maps made in Esri Story Maps we will explore remote worker’s origin and destination cities to better understand where people are moving to. Tableau will also be used to create supporting visualizations will be done through charts or graphs that provide more context into urban areas by focusing on demographic and cost of living measures, for instance.
