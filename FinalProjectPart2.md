# Final Project, Part Two #

Part Two of the final project involved pivoting from the data narrative proposed in [Part One](https://gisgomez.github.io/Gomez-Portfolio-2022/FinalProject) further developing a wireframe and storyboard for the new data narrative, and establishing a user research protocol which includes conducting user research interviews. The process behind Part Two is outlined below, but first some context about the data narrative pivot from Part One.

In Part One, the data narrative focused around changes in urban geography due to the mass adoption of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the narrative was compelling, there were several issues with finding data to support further research on the topic especially given the recency of these changes. Data that examines the post-COVID urban environment is hard to find partly because it is a process that is unfolding in real-time and so the project scope and direction had to be reconsidered. 

The data narrative in Part Two is inspired from the topic proposed in Part One but takes a more narrow and specific approach to the broad topic of life after COVID-19. The premise of the new data narrative is centered around the proliferation of telehealth services during the pandemic and the implication on people’s access to healthcare services. The storyline will examine pre- and post-pandemic access to telemedicine, either at the state or county level, and will examine the demographics of telemedicine users to determine if there has been greater patient participation in healthcare and greater access to health-related services. The data story will also consider that as we have moved towards mass vaccination, healthcare is once again beginning to readjust to new norms and COVID-era expansion of telemedicine may be decreasing. Finally, the call to action involves inviting the audience to support legislation in favor of requiring health insurance providers to cover telemedicine and maintain state and federal funding allocated to helping individuals cover the costs of telemedicine moving forward. 

The process of further exploring this data narrative via wireframing and user research is detailed below. 

# Wireframe and Storyboard #



# User Research Protocol #
## Target Audience ##
The intended target audience for this data story is quite broad as it includes anyone who might seek services from a healthcare provider, regardless of whether or not they have previously accessed healthcare services via a telehealth platform. Perhaps the data narrative will resonate more positively or negatively with those who sought healthcare services throughout the pandemic and were directed to telehealth platforms instead of traditional methods of service. These individuals might have either developed an affinity for telehealth and its associated benefits of increased flexibility and patient access, or might have developed some resistance to telehealth due to personal preferences and the deviation from traditional delivery methods. 

## Interview Selection Approach ##
Given the intended target audience, the approach to identifying individuals to interview will take into consideration the criteria outlined below:
* Is 18 years old or older and is presently enrolled in a health insurance plan 
* Is currently seeing or has recently (since mid-2020) seen a healthcare provider either in-person or via telehealth
* Is willing to disclose whether they have or have not received healthcare services via telehealth platforms
  * If an individual has ever received healthcare services via telehealth platforms, whether or not this experience occurred during the pandemic 
  * If an individual has not previously accessed healthcare services via telehealth platforms, whether or not they would be open and willing to pursue that option as an avenue for care in the future 

There will be equal consideration for users who have and have not accessed healthcare services via telehealth platforms and users who did and did not use telehealth services during the pandemic in order to better understand both perspectives  

## Interview Script ##

The interview script is detailed below. 

_Thank you for your willingness to participate in this interview. To provide some further context, I am conducting user research interviews for a data-driven project on the evolution of healthcare services throughout the pandemic._

_Before we begin the interview, I would like to briefly provide a brief synopsis of the project’s narrative. As you know, the pandemic caused radical shifts in all aspects of everyday life and has notably disrupted one aspect in particular: healthcare, from both the patient perspective with the emergence of telehealth services, and from the provider perspective, with the normalization of remote work. Telehealth services rapidly grew during the COVID-19 pandemic and as we have moved towards vaccination healthcare is once again beginning to readjust to new norms. This interview seeks to explore your experience with healthcare services throughout the pandemic and understand your perspective about next steps in terms of policy around telehealth regulation._ 

_You were identified as an interview candidate because of your age, access to health insurance, and willingness to openly discuss your experience with healthcare providers since the pandemic’s start in mid-2020. Given the topic of this interview, I would like to disclose upfront that you are not being asked to provide or reveal any sensitive or personal information, but rather you are being asked about your sentiment towards two mediums for accessing healthcare: telehealth or in-person. At any time please feel comfortable to pause or stop the interview if you feel you need to do so. I also want to extend you the opportunity to ask any questions before we start. Should you not have any questions at this time, we may circle back at the end of the interview session._ 

_I would like to first begin with a couple of open discovery questions to get to know you a bit better._  
* _How often do you seek healthcare services? This could include but is not limited to general consultations, check ups, and mental health services._
* _How did the pandemic affect the way you interact with providers and access healthcare services?_
* _Since 2020, how many times have you met in-person or via telehealth platforms with a healthcare provider?_

_Thank you for your input. Next, I would like to ask some further questions to better understand the context of your access to healthcare services. 
*Could you describe the last time you saw a healthcare provider, were you in-person or did you meet via a telehealth platform? (Note: Adjust the following questions based on the interviewee’s response)_
* _What do you think about your experience with healthcare services being provided in-person//via telehealth applications?_ 
* _What is the most frustrating part about in-person/telehealth visits with healthcare providers?_
* _What is the most helpful part about in-person/telehealth visits with healthcare providers?_
* _What do you feel is different between an in-person and a telehealth visit? Do you have a personal preference and why might that be?_
* _Would you be willing to try telehealth over an in-person visit (or vice versa, depending on the interviewee’s response)?_

_Thanks for the feedback. I would like to wrap up with a walkthrough of a data story wireframe and you some questions about the data visualizations I have prepared for our interview today._  
* _What are your thoughts on the data visualizations shown in this wireframe?_
* _What about the data inspires curiosity or intrigue for you, and what about the data does not surprise you?_ 
* _What are your thoughts on states across the country changing laws or policies during the pandemic to require more robust insurance coverage of telemedicine?_ 
* _Do you feel that adjustment should be revisited as we move through the pandemic?_ 
* _How does this issue impact you specifically and what would you like to see done differently?_
* _What data, metrics, or statistics do you feel are missing and would provide valuable insight?_

_Thank you for sharing and thank you for your participation and openness throughout this interview. I am grateful for your willingness to share your experience and thoughts around telemedicine and welcome you to ask any questions or share any last thoughts at this time._

_Thanks again for your time and participation._

## Interview Findings ##

Four individuals were interviewed using the script above. The names of the individuals will be omitted for privacy purposes, but the age and gender of the interviewees will be provided to add some context to the interview findings. Throughout this discussion, the interviewees will be referred to as their sex and age: Female, 29, Male, 29, Female, 24, and Female, 26. Of those interviewed, Male, 29 and Female, 28 disclosed that they had only exclusively done in-person visits, and Female, 24 and Female, 29 disclosed that they had done both in-person and telehealth visits. This is an important point of distinction as throughout the interviews differences in perspective and preference emerged based on the individual’s previous exposure to telehealth. 

#### Interviewee-Specific Questions ####

Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of the interviewees did not frequently seek out healthcare services, either because of schedule constraints or because of a lack of need to do so. The other half did frequently seek healthcare services, specifically in the form of therapy or counseling. Those who did not frequently seek healthcare services experienced little to no COVID-related disruptions to services, but those who did frequent healthcare services did experience disruptions. Female, 24 shared that she had to move from in-person therapy to a telehealth platform during the height of the pandemic and that this adjustment remained in place since. Female, 29 explained something similar but added that after the height of the pandemic the choice to be in-person or meet via a telehealth platform moving forward was up to her. 

The interviewees who had exposure to only in-person healthcare services tended to be less in favor of telemedicine though they did acknowledge the benefits associated with the flexibility of telehealth services. Male, 29, remarked that telehealth would not feel as comfortable compared to in-person visits as the exchange with a provider might feel “inorganic” or“awkward.” Female, 26 commented that telehealth might make it difficult for her to ask questions, "read a provider’s body language, or pick up on “non-verbal cues” which might impact her likelihood to consult with the same provider in the future. The interviewees who had exposure to both in-person and telehealth services shared similar perspectives to Male, 29 and Female, 26 but remarked that having history with a provider made the process of transitioning to telehealth far easier than starting with a new provider via telehealth. Of those who had exposure to telehealth services, the most cited benefit was in regards to time and efficiency as they felt telemedicine made it far easier to allocate time for appointments since transportation and wait times were removed from their consideration.

#### Data Reflections ####

When shown the survey data on patients' access and use to telemedicine based on providers who offered telemedicine as a service option, all but Female, 26 were not surprised by the number of individuals who had access to providers who offered telemedicine as an option. Male, 29 was somewhat surprised by the fact that so many providers were willing to offer telemedicine as a method of providing services to patients. When shown the data on how many survey respondents booked telemedicine appointments, Female, 24 and Female, 29 were both observant of the fact that those who were 65 years old or older had the highest percentage of people who scheduled one or more telehealth appointments; this was not surprising to them but rather supported their own expectations around the target audience of telehealth. All of the interviewees were intrigued by the data showing the percentage of providers who offered telehealth services prior to the pandemic as the prevailing sentiment pointed to expecting fewer providers to offer telehealth services. One interviewee expressed that they “didn’t think providers had the infrastructure to facilitate telemedicine prior to the pandemic” and another commented that providers “had no incentive” to offer telemedicine since it was not needed pre-COVID and might have caused providers to incur extra costs. Data showing the states who required insurers to cover telemedicine services pre- and post-pandemic generated curiosity from all respondents as there was some level of surprise in regards to the number of states who had pre-pandemic requirements around telemedicine service coverage. 

## Moving Forward ##

I felt the interview script significantly helped in facilitating thoughtful and insightful conversation with the interviewees. The user research interviews were very helpful in contextualizing the storyline and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the data narrative. Below is an overview of the feedback received from interviewees. Moving forward this feedback will be taken into consideration and integrated into changes for part three of the final project. 
* Strengths
  * One interviewee commented that the layout and order of the interview questions were useful in easing interviewees into the topic of conversation and helped them feel more comfortable in sharing their perspectives
  * The data is effective at producing reactions that challenged interviewee’s expectations which gives way to more robust conversations 
  * Most interviewees agreed that the wireframe structure, layout, and composition is easy to read and understand 
  * The data and statistics included in the data story are effective metrics 
  * The call to action is clear and is something that one interviewee would feel comfortable taking immediate action on 
* Weaknesses
  * There is a slight disconnect between the interview questions and the data narrative; the interview questions seem to take into consideration things that the data does not challenge or support, and vice versa
  * There is missing data points around other metrics; one interviewee commented that they would have liked to see data about what particular health industries saw an increase in telehealth usage 
  * The wireframe could use more detailed data visualizations
  * There should be an effort to establish a color scheme to use throughout the entire data story in order to achieve visual clarity and cohesiveness  
  * The aspect of legislation around state and federal coverage of telemedicine needs to be more incorporated into the data story, either via data visualizations or some further discussion
